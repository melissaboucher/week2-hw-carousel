# CodePath Week 2 Project: Carousel

The purpose of this homework is to leverage views, view properties, and events to create a high fidelity prototype that is difficult to distinguish from a production app. In this exercise I've implemented the Carousel app from the signed out state to the basic signed in state.

Time spent: 11 hours spent in total
